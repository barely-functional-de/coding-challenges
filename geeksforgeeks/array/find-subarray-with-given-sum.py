Find Subarray with given Sum from Array of non-negative Numbers
Last Updated : 19 Jul, 2024
Given a 1-based indexing array arr[] of non-negative integers and an integer sum. 
You mainly need to return the left and right indexes(1-based indexing) of that subarray. 
In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray indexes which come first on moving from left to right. 
If no such subarray exists return an array consisting of element -1.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = { 15, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 10, 23}, sum = 23
Output: 2 5
Explanation: Sum of elements between indices 2 and 5 is 2 + 4 + 8 + 9 = 23

"""
[Expected Approach] Using Sliding Window â€“ O(N) time and O(1) auxiliary space
The idea is simple, as we know that all the elements in subarray are positive so, 
If a subarray has sum greater than the given sum then there is no possibility that adding elements to the current subarray will be equal to the given sum. 
So the Idea is to use a similar approach to a sliding window. 

Start with an empty subarray 
add elements to the subarray until the sum is less than k( given sum). 
If the sum is greater than k, remove elements from the start of the current subarray.
